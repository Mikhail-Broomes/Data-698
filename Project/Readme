# ⚡ Electricity Load Forecasting & Grid Anomaly Detection

![project-banner](https://your-banner-url.com)

## 📘 Overview

This project develops a robust, explainable, and deployable machine learning pipeline for electricity demand forecasting and anomaly detection, leveraging real-world grid and weather data from Spain.

It integrates:
- Classical time series modeling (ARIMA/ARIMAX)
- Machine learning (XGBoost, Random Forest)
- Hybrid modeling
- SHAP for explainability
- Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
- Forecasting at 1h, 24h, and 7-day horizons

## 🔧 Methods Used

- **ARIMA / ARIMAX**: Time series forecasting with exogenous weather variables
- **XGBoost**: Tree-based boosting model with lag + calendar + weather features
- **Hybrid ARIMA + ML**: Combine statistical and residual-based ML correction
- **SHAP**: Explainable AI to visualize feature impact on each prediction
- **Isolation Forest**: Detect abnormal grid behavior from residuals
